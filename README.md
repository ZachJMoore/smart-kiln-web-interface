# Smart Kiln
This is the web interface for the "Smart Kiln" project.

### Features

Working:

- Manage multiple kilns from one place
- Check temperature, start and stop from anywhere
- Store all firing schedules in the cloud on a personal account
- Graph past temperatures

To Be Added:

- Notifications at certain temperature set points

## Purpose & Goal

The main purpose behind this project is to create better, smarter, cheaper, and more accessible kiln controllers. Whether that be for ceramics, glass, curing, or any other application, my aim is to lower the cost while bringing a better experience for beginners and experienced craftsmen alike.

The inspiration is based off my experience as a ceramic artist working with specialty crystalline glaze. Growing good zinc-silicate crystals in the kiln requires specific firing schedules with holds at certain temperatures in order to facilitate the wanted growth and color. In manual, or simple PID controlled kilns, this would be a tedious process and require constant attendance during the entire firing process. I wanted to create something that could help others more easily get into crystalline glazes or be able to have greater control without having to invest in an expensive kiln controller.

### Getting up and running

In the root folder run the following in the terminal

```
    $ yarn
    $ yarn start
```
